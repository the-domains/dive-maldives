If you are a keen diver and like to dive in exotic locations then you will definitely want to consider booking a holiday in the Maldives or perhaps you already have and are looking forward to an incredible and unforgettable experience.

## Types of Diving

There are a variety of different types of dives which you can take part in on your visit to the Maldives. You may just want to stick to the most common type which is a basic scuba dive. There are many different places around the islands where you can take part in a scuba diving session so you will be spoilt for choice. Another type of dive you may want to consider is a night dive which will involve navigating the ocean floor with a flashlight or other artificial light source in total darkness. This will give you the chance to see many nocturnal fish which are not visible during the day. You also have the chance to take part in a wreck dive which involves diving to explore several boats purposefully put on the ocean floor and which have been taken over by coral reefs. Or if you can't decide you may as well try all of them.

## What will I see?

The Maldives is blessed to have some beautiful coral reefs on the ocean floor around the islands. Whilst diving you will be able to see the many bright colours of the anemone and the breath taking tropical fish which live amongst them. With hundreds of different species you are bound to see many sights that make it so worth while. There are also some larger fish which live in the islands' waters. There are several types of shark you have the chance to get up close too including the reef shark and the hammerhead shark. There is also the magnificent manta ray and plenty of tuna which helps to keep the local economy afloat.
