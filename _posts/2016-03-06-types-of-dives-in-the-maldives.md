Thanks to its white sandy beaches, tropical weather, coral reefs and an abundance of exotic marine life, the Maldives has become a premier diving location - popular with divers worldwide.

Whether staying on land in one of the many five star resorts or on board one of the readily available live on diving boats, you are sure to be amazed with the dives the Maldives have to offer. With over 50 dives sites available and more to be discovered, there's something for everyone - from beginners to seasoned professionals.

All Maldivian dives include a lot of water movement, this is what makes them so vibrant but before you arrive you should be aware of the three main dive types.

## Lagoon

Lagoons are perfect for dive lessons. They are more protected from the currents than the other locations and typically only reach depths of 20 meters.

## Thila

Underwater islands, found in many dive locations throughout the Maldives. They vary in size, some you can dive completely around while others you'll only see one side during a single dive.

## Kandu

A channel or pass where large amounts of water move with the tides. These are the perfect locations to see large fish and marine life including manta rays, sharks and turtles.

Another popular type of Maldivian dive locations are wreck sites. Three of the most popular wreck dives are the Victory, British Loyalty and The Shipyard wreck sites.

## Victory wreck

Since the 110 metre long vessel sunk in 1981 on the western side of Hulhule Island, it has become home to exotic marine life.

## The British Loyalty wreck

The 140 metre vessel was neutralised by Japanese torpedoes in 1946\. This wreck is unique in that is allows beginner divers to experience the thrill of exploring a wreck, the upper region is only 17 meters from the water surface.

## The Shipyard

This unique site has two boats in one location and home to many exotic fish.
