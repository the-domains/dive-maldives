Anyone planning an upcoming holiday to the Maldives may want to consider taking part in some diving on their holiday. There are several different types which might interest all and all offer something different which the others do not.

## Drift Diving

A drift dive is a type of scuba dive but instead of swimming to where you want to go to, you instead let the currents guide you around the ocean floor. This type of dive is for experienced divers only and will require some training due to the obvious dangers it possesses compared to a regular scuba dive.

## Night Diving

A night dive is like a regular scuba dive but takes place at night instead giving you a completely different experience of the sea floor. You will guide yourself with an artificial light source such as a flashlight and will see many nocturnal species of fish which you will not be able to see during the day. You will also notice some amazing changes to some of the anemone in the beautiful coral reefs which will extend some of their tentacles which are relaxed during the day.

## Wreck Diving

Around the coast of the Maldives several boats have been placed on the ocean floor and a coral reef has been allowed to develop on it. Many stunning species of fish can now call the sunken boats their home. When taking part in a wreck dive you will not only get to explore a stunning coral reef but also see for yourself just how nature can take over a man made object if given the chance.

## Liveaboard Diving

[A liveaboard diving experience][0] involves staying on a boat for several nights and traveling around the Maldives giving you the chance in many different locations. As some fish are more numerous in certain areas than others you will visit lots of different locations so you can see a variety of different sea life.

There is certainly no shortage of the types of dives you can take part in. You can choose your favourite or perhaps try out them all.
